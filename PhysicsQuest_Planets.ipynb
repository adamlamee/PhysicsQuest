    "### Part 1\n",
    "- It looks like Saturn has 82 moons!  \n",
    "- Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune each have average temperatures below freezing.  \n",
    "- Jupiter is the most massive planet at 1898 x 10<sup>24</sup> kg.  \n",
    "- Orbital period is the number of days to go around the Sun. We also call that a \"year\". The Earth takes about 365 days to make one full orbit.  \n",
    "- All planets have elliptical (or oval-shaped) orbits. Venus has an eccentricity close to zero, meaning its orbit is very circular. Mercury's orbital eccentricity is largest at 0.205. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2\n",
    "- When you first run the code, it graphs number of moons (y-axis) vs. average distance from the Sun (x-axis).  \n",
    "- As distance from the Sun increases, these are some of the patterns you might have seen:  \n",
    "    - period *increases*, in part because planets are traveling a longer distance.  \n",
    "    - farther planets have *slower* velocities. If they moved faster, the Sun's gravity wouldn't be strong enough to keep them in orbit and they'd leave our solar system.  \n",
    "    - there isn't much of a relationship between eccentricity and the distance from the Sun.  \n",
    "    - temperature *decreases* since you're farther from the Sun (that's helps keep us warm).  \n",
    "    - the four outer planets, called *gas giants*, are much heavier than the four inner *rocky* planets due to how our early solar system formed.   \n",
    "    - Jupiter and Saturn have the most moons. They're also the most massive planets with stronger gravity to attract other objects.  "
