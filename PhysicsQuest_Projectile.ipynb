    "### Part 1  \n",
    "- To start, the code has the initial velocity set to 20 cm/s.  \n",
    "- **initial_v** is short for \"initial velocity\", how fast the ball was launched off the table.  \n",
    "- Height was stored in a variable named **initial_y** because height is position in the y-direction. It helps to give variables useful names, but we sometimes shorten them to make the code easier to read.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2  \n",
    "- At first, the loop generates 13 data points. If you change how much time is added in each loop, the number of points will probably be different.  \n",
    "- The loop calculates x and y coordinates for the ball's motion only as long as the y-value is greater than zero. That's higher than the floor. When that isn't the case anymore, the loop stops.  \n",
    "- Having the loop caluclate the ball's position every 0.05 seconds should generate 25 points before it reaches the floor (and the loop stops).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3  \n",
    "- For an initial velocity of 20 cm/s, the graph shows the ball traveling a little more than 20 cm.  \n",
    "- The points get farther apart because the ball speeds up. When it moves faster, the ball travels a greater distance in the same amount of time (0.1 s or whatever you set you loop for).  \n",
    "- With an initial velocity of 40 cm/s, the ball travels about 45 cm. That's twice as far as before.  "
