    "- If your code runs without errors and displays a new data table, great job! If not, try opening a [clean copy of the activity](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/PhysicsQuest/blob/master/PhysicsQuest_Pendulum.ipynb) and be sure you don't edit any of the syntax (like ' or [ ] or , ).  \n",

    "- A good comment after the line with plt.title() would be: # adds a title to the graph  \n",
    "- **Alpha** adjusts the transparency of the points on the graph. You can set it between 0 (totally transparent) and 1 (totally opaque).  \n",
    "- **s** is short for marker *size* and controlls how big the points are on the graph.  \n",
    "- Deleting the # at the beginning of a line of code will *uncomment* that line and let the program read it. Try doing that with grid, xlim, and ylim.  \n",
    "- The shape of the markers is set in the plt.scatter line with the parameter *marker*.  [This page](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.2/api/markers_api.html#module-matplotlib.markers) has lots of other options for marker shapes.  "
